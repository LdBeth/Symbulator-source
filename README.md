# Symbulator for TI M86k series calculators

This is plain text source code for Symbulator based on
https://github.com/Symbulator-Team/TI-89 with minor bug fixes, and an
additional function `ws()` that would create some helper functions.

This version is named `6Δ` to differentiate from `Version 6β - July 5 2014`
in the original source.
